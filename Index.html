<h1> Biography</h1>
<p></p>

</body> My name is Hedy Sussy Flores but I rather people call me Sussy, which is my middle name. I was born and raised in the Bronx. I’ll be honest and admit that I have been a handful for my parents. I started off my first year in high school with not the greatest attitude and I didn’t really care much for my classes and my education. Entering my sophomore year, I was still in that mindset and actually even worse. This is the year that I have really taken it upon myself to make an effort and work hard to not repeat the mistakes I have made in the past two years.  I am interested in modeling because I want to bring more attention to the hispanic beauty which is what I see myself doing in the future.I am a young girl with an imagination that is beyond this world, i want to be many things in life but a main goal is to be happy while doing the career I specifically like which is fashion designing as well a hardware engineer for the army. Sports, I enjoy playing any sports especially to keep my body in fit, not only that but as well for my true love and passion soccer. I have been impacted by the negative remarks made about the Mexican community and the Mexican people. I have taken it upon myself to not only prove to myself that I can make it far and succeed, but also prove to society that not all Mexicans are criminals.
